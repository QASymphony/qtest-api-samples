SYNOPSIS

    uploadNewmanToQTest [options]

DESCRIPTION

    Uploads the given files to qTest Manager as test execution results linking to existing test cases

USAGE
    -f file             Test result file

    -m format           Format of test result file, options are: newman-json, newman-xunit

    -i usetestcaseid    If true, will assume name of test result is the test case ID (fastest)
                        If false, will assume name of test result is the test case name

    -r regex            Where the ID or name is looked for (based on usetestcaseid)
                        By default it is the entire test case name

                        Example: (\D+)* if we're looking for digits at the start
                        TC_Name_(.+)$ if we're looking for a name after the words 
                        TC_Name_ to the end

    -p parentid         This will look for a matching Release, then Test Cycle, 
                        then Test Suite for a matching name
                        This will be the directory structure we will look under
                        for matching test executions

                        NOTE: If a test execution appears twice, BOTH execution results will be added
    
    -t parenttype       The tyep of folder to look in to store the test results. this is related to parentid
                        Values can be 'release' 'test-suite' or 'test-cycle'
    
    -c credentials      The file that has the appropriate qTest Credentials for this script.
                        It should be json content like:
                        {
                        email: "Elise",
                        password: "password",
                        qtesturl: "https://qas.qtestnet.com",
                        project: "API Automation Integration Demo Project"
                        }
